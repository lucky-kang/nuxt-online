      <p>
        Thank you for visiting our shop. We are a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;millennials who decided to do something in order to help female hand-crafters in third-world countries after we had traveled to southeastern Asia for our graduation trip.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        All of our blankets, tapestries, and rattan serving trays are from undeveloped countries in southeastern Asia, such as Nepal and Vietnam. Our products are handwoven by local female hand-crafters. We believe in fair trade and we always look after for fair wages and a sustainable environment.&nbsp;
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        All of our products are of very good quality, but we are offering a reasonable price for our customers. We can do this because we directly work with local people, who are involved in the entire production process, which means there is no third party in between.
      </p><br/>

        <span style="font-weight:700;">Frisson</span>&nbsp;(French for "shiver"), also known as&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:700;">aesthetic chills</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:700;">musical chills</span>, is a psychophysiological response to&nbsp;rewarding&nbsp;auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable&nbsp;state. People who experience frissons are more likely to be open to new experiences, have active imaginations, see the beauty in nature, love variety and often think very deeply about their feelings. They may be more emotional than others and are very curious.&nbsp;
